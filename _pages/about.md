I am a PhD student in the Technology and Social Behavior program [Technology and Social Behavior program](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/tsb-program/). My research interests are in expansive learning opportunities for students from under-served communities, and collective reasoning in socio-technical systems. 
I work with [Marcelo Worsley](http://marceloworsley.com/) in the [tiilt lab](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/), and [Agnes Horvat](http://www.agneshorvat.info/) in the [Link lab](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/). I earned a MS in Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh, and BS in Liberal Arts from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico.
