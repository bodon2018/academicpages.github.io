I am deeply passionate about assisting people learn computer science (cs) and using computing technologies to enhance human capabilities. I am a PhD student in the [Technology and Social Behavior program](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/tsb-program/), a joint program in Computer Science and Communication Studies. My research interests are learning opportunities for students from under-served communities and collective reasoning. I work with [Marcelo Worsley](http://marceloworsley.com/) in the [tiilt lab](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/), and [Agnes Horvat](http://www.agneshorvat.info/) in the [link lab](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/). I earned a BS in Liberal Arts with a minor in Entrepreneurship from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico and an MS in Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh, where I was a Commonwealth Scholar.

### Projects

* SportSense:
    Investigating sports and physical education as a space to build students' and coaches' perceptions and interest in
    cs. For more information, check out this [site](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/projects/sportsanalytics/index.html).   
* Online Dissemination of Science:
    Who is more likely to share and discuss retracted papers on Twitter before a scientific article is retracted. For more information, check out this [site](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science-research/).

### Teaching

  I enjoy making technology accessible to all. Before Northwestern, I worked with youths to teach them about technology and computational thinking at the Grayson Center in the Hill District and taught tech skills to the elderly at the Pittsburghâ€™s Community Engagement Center in Homewood.
 
 
### Community Service

  An essential aspect of my work is to partner with community organizations interested in cs education and to seek to adopt technology to improve their processes. Some of my work includes advising underrepresented students on computing careers through virtual and in-person interactions, visiting public schools to present basics of cs, and assisting a medical facility in upgrading its electronic records system.

### Personal

  I was born and raised in southern Puerto Rico. I enjoy outdoor activities and sports. I learned many techniques from my mother, who taught special education.
