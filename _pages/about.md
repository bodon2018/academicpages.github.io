I am deeply passionate about providing experiences to learning cs, and using computing technologies to enhance human capabilities. I am a PhD student in the [Technology and Social Behavior program](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/tsb-program/), a joint program in Computer Science and Communication Studies. My research interests are in expansive learning opportunities for students from under-served communities, and collective reasoning in socio-technical systems. I work with [Marcelo Worsley](http://marceloworsley.com/) in the [tiilt lab](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/), and [Agnes Horvat](http://www.agneshorvat.info/) in the [link lab](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/). I earned a MS in Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh, and BS in Liberal Arts with a minor in Entrepernurship from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico. Below you will find an overview of my work.

### Projects 

* Sports Sense: 
    Investigating sports and physical education as an space to build students and coaches perceptions and interest in
    computer science. For more information check out this [site](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/projects/sportsanalytics/index.html).   
* Online Dissemination of Science:
    Studying who is more likely to share and discuss retracted papers on Twitter before a scientific article is retracted. For more information check out this [site](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science-research/). 

### Teaching

  I enjoy making technology accesible to all. Before Northwestern, I worked with youths to teach them about technology and computational thinking at the Grayson Center in the Hill District, and taught tech skills to the elderly at the Pittsburghâ€™s Community Engagement Center in Homewood.
  
  
### Community Service 

  An important aspect of my work is to partner with community organizations interested in cs education, and/or seek to adopt technology to improve their processes. Some of my work includes advising underrepresented students on computing careers through virtual and in-person interactions, visiting high schools to present basics of cs, and assisting a medical facility in upgrading their electronic records system.

### Personal 

  I was born and raised in southern Puerto Rico. I enjoy playing sports and outdoors. My mother was a teacher in special education.
