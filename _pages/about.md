I am a PhD student in the Technology and Social Behavior program [Technology and Social Behavior program](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/tsb-program/). My research interests are in expansive learning opportunities for students from under-served communities, and collective reasoning in socio-technical systems. 
I work with [Marcelo Worsley](http://marceloworsley.com/) in the [tiilt lab](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/), and [Agnes Horvat](http://www.agneshorvat.info/) in the [Link lab](https://link.soc.northwestern.edu/). I earned a MS in Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh, and BS in Liberal Arts from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico.

Sports Sense

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository.

Online diseemination of Science

The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Personal 
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
